This file is used to define the initial state of the NCAR Smart Switch in the WVD labview program. 

### UDP communication location of the Smart Switch - 1) IP address, 2) port number (bind),
### 3) port number (send);; 
UDP Comms;;
192.168.0.199;24499;24599;;

### Setting the state of the clock digital controls. These are all array elements
### and all index from lowest to highest

### Smart Switch parameters.  1) Number of possible pulse blocks, 2) Number
### of timers in each pulse block, 3) FPGA clock rate [Hz]
Size;;
32;16;200000000;;

### Laser pulse repetition frequency. Units are [Hz]
PRF;;
8000;8000;8000;;

### Time after pulse block is executed to wait. Units are [us]
Block Post Time;;
0;0;0;;

### Duty cycle of online/offline laser to use. This is specifically duty cycle of the 
### offline laser where the online will be the compliment. 
Duty Cycle;;
0.5;0.5;0.5;;

### Total number of pulses to run for each pulse block
Total Pulses;;
2;2;2;;

### Duration of the TSOA pulse. Units are [us]
Pulse Duration;;
1;0.2;1;;

### Boolean value to force the trigger to happen at the center of the TSOA pulse. 
### 0: Start trigger with the start of the TSOA, 1: Move trigger to the center of the 
### TSOA pulse
Center Pulse;;
1;1;1;;

### Extra time to add to the Traveling Wave Amplifier. This value is tacked onto the end
### of the pulse such that the TWA pulse length is Pulse Duration + Extra TWA. Units are
### [us]
Extra TWA;;
0.1;0.1;0.1;;

### Extra time to add to the Gate. This value is tacked onto the start and the end
### of the pulse such that the gate pulse length is Pulse Duration + Extra TWA + 2x
### Extra Gate. Units are [us]
Extra Gate;;
0.1;0.1;0.1;;

### Which sync to use to tell teh MCS to start. Options are: 0, 1, 2, or 3.
Sync;;
0;0;0;;

### Which MCS instance to target. In the current firmware, data channels 0-5 reside on  
### MCS 0, data channels 6-11 reside on MCS 1, data channels 12-17 reside on MCS 2, and 
### data channels 18-23 reside on MCS 3. Options are: 0, 1, 2, or 3.
MCS Instance;;
0;1;0;;

### Boolean value for how the TSOA Key should be implimented. For now, please just leave 
### as 1. Other options will cause software issues. 
TSOA Key;;
1;1;1;;

### Option defining how the TSOA should pulse. 0: Operations, 1: Off
TSOA Setting;;
0;0;1;;

### Option defining how the 1x1 switch should pulse. 0: Operations, 1: Off
1x1 Setting;;
0;0;0;;

### Option defining how the Gate should pulse. 0: Operations, 1: Off
Gate Setting;;
0;0;0;;

### Used to scale the output power for the TWA. This setting is for DAC output 0 and is 
### meant to be hooked to the WV Online laser. Variable is 16 bits so the bounds are 0 -> 
### 65535. To convert to voltage: Voltage = 5 x Value/65535. 
DAC Online 1;;
65535;65535;20000;;

### Used to scale the output power for the TWA. This setting is for DAC output 1 and is 
### meant to be hooked to the WV Offline laser. Variable is 16 bits so the bounds are 0 -> 
### 65535. To convert to voltage: Voltage = 5 x Value/65535. 
DAC Offline 1;;
65535;65535;20000;;

### Used to scale the output power for the TWA. This setting is for DAC output 2 and is 
### meant to be hooked to the O2 Online laser. Variable is 16 bits so the bounds are 0 -> 
### 65535. To convert to voltage: Voltage = 5 x Value/65535. 
DAC Online 2;;
65535;65535;20000;;

### Used to scale the output power for the TWA. This setting is for DAC output 3 and is 
### meant to be hooked to the O2 Offline laser. Variable is 16 bits so the bounds are 0 -> 
### 65535. To convert to voltage: Voltage = 5 x Value/65535. 
DAC Offline 2;;
65535;65535;20000;;

### A map to used to define to define what is connected to each SmartSwitch timer. Definitions
### are provided in: TypeDef_SmartSwitchTimerType.ctl. 
Timer Map;;
1;2;3;4;5;6;0;0;0;7;8;9;0;0;0;0;;

### The timer blocks to cycle between. 1) Starting block, 2) Ending block, 3) How to cycle those
### blocks: 1: Force blocks to be the same, 0: Allow blocks to be different. Note that this control
### will not check the configure file input but first be enacted when the user tries to change blocks
Start Stop Blocks;;
0;0;1;;
