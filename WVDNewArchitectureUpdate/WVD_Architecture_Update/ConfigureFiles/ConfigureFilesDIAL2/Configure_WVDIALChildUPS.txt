This file is used to define the initial state of the MPD main UPS labview program.

### This is where the Labview code should find the UPS. The elements here are:
### 1) IP Address, 2) Port, 3) Communication timeout in [ms], 4) Header bytes,
### and 5) Bytes to read if the element is an IP address.
Thermocouple Comm Port;;
192.168.0.231;-1;750;-1;-1;;

### These are miscellaneous variables that are read and used as default values
### by the UPS. These are currently: 1) the update period of the UPS in seconds,
### 2) the number of measurements to save, 3) The minimum battery percent before
### a shutdown is triggered, and 4) The number of measurements required with the
### UPS on battery before the shutdown will be allowed.
Child Variables;;
8;3600;10;50;;

### File paths to the data storage and data logging locations and functions. The order
### is 1) Where to write the raw data, 2) What base name to call the UPS data files,
### 3) What base name to call the logging files, 4) Where to find the user logging
### program, and 5) Where to find the user permissions program
