This file is used to define the initial state of the MPD main laser locking labview program.

### These settings just set the names of the tab controller so the user knows
### what is contained in each large piece
Outter Tab Names;;
Wavelength Settings; Scan Details; Wavelength Status; Data Saving; Data Plotting;;

### These settings just set the names of the inner tab controller so the user knows
### what is contained in each large piece
Inner Tab Names;;
Laser Temperatures; Laser Wavelengths; Etalon Temperatures; Laser Seed Power;;

### These are miscellaneous settings needed for the laser locking program. They are:
### 1) the time between checks of the etalons in seconds, 2) the number of data scans to
### keep and plot, 3) whether to check the lasers or not (1 = yes and 0 = no) even if
### they should not be locked, 4) whether the program is running in software testing
### mode or as standard (this option is currently not set up), 5) what type of switch
### to use for the wavemeter (see TypeDef_WavemeterSwitchType.ctl for details), 6) the
### time between locking steps in seconds, and 7) The wave meter offset in nanometers

### This is the maximum allowable time that a laser is allowed to try to lock itself 
### before it times out, in seconds.

### This is a boolean operator to set whether the lasers should try to lock themselves
### or just simply check their status (1 = yes lock and 0 = just check)

1;1;1;1;;

### This is a boolean operator to set whether the lasers should try to lock themselves 
### using a single step or PID control method (1 = single step and 0 = PID)
Locking Type;;

### This is the current and only locking method for locking the laser. This is the 
### temperature step size to take when trying to temperature tune the lasers in 
### degrees Celsius
Lock Step Size;;
0.001;0.001;0.001;0.001;;

### This is the minimum power required to be read from the wavemeter to perform laser
### locking. This value is compared to the value read by the wavemeter. The units are
### dBm
Min Locking Power;;
-15;-15;-15;-15;;

### This is an array describing how the lasers should try to lock themselves. These 
### numbers correspond to the array location of each laser. The scan: 0;1;2;; would check
### each of the 3 lasers once before returning to the original. The scan: 0;0;0;0;1;;
### would check the first laser 4 times before checking the other.
Scan Strategy;;

### The type of etalon that is being used. This corresponds to the type definition
### TypeDef_EtalonTypes.ctl

### File paths to the data storage and data logging locations and functions. The order is
### 1) Where to write the raw data, 2) What base name to call the laser data files, 3)
### What base name to call the etalon data files, 4) What base name to call the logging
### files, 5) Where to find the User Logging program, and 6) Where to find the user
