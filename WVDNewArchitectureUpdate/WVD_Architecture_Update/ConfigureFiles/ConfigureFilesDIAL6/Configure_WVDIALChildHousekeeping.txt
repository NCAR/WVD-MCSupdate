This file is used to define the initial state of the MPD main thermocouple labview program.

### This is where the Labview program should find the weather station. The elements here
### are: 1) IP Address, 2) Port, 3) Communication timeout in [ms], 4) Header bytes, and
### 5) Bytes to read
Thermocouple Comm Port;;
192.168.0.165;502;3000;-1;-1;;

### These are miscellaneous variables that are read and used as default values
### by the thermocouple program. These are currently: 1) the update period of the
### thermocouples in seconds, 2) The number of measurements to save, and 3) the number of
### thermocouples present
Child Variables;;
8;900;8;;

### Locations of the thermocouples in the ADAM module. For translation of the numbers
### see TypeDef_ThermocoupleLocations.ctl.
Thermocouple Locations;;
2;10;3;5;6;7;8;9;;

### File paths to the data storage and data logging locations and functions. The order is
### 1) Where to write the raw data, 2) What base name to call the thermocouple data files,
### 3) What base name to call the logging files, 4) Where to find the user logging program,
### and 5) Where to find the user permissions program
