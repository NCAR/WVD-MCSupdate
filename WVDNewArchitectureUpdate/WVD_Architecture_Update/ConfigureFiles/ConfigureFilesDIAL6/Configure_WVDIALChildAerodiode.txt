This file is used to define the initial state of the MPD main pulsed TWA labview program.

### These settings just set the names of the tab controller so the user knows
### what is contained in each large piece
Outter Tab Names;;
Connection Details; Desired State; Current State; Testing;;

### These are miscellaneous settings needed for the Aerodiode program. They are:
### 1) Software Testing (0 = No, 1 = Yes), and 2) Hardware Interrupt (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Misc;; 
0;1;;

### The comm ports used by each of the Aerodiode device drivers. Note that these are in
### order to match the Seed diodes. That order is typically WV-Online, WV-Offline,
### O2-Online, and O2-Offline
Communication Ports;;
COM6;COM4;COM5;COM7;;

### The source of the current for the Aerodiode to use (0 = External, 1 = Internal)
Current Source;;
1;1;1;1;;

### The mode for the current driver to use (0 = Pulsed, 1 = CW)
Control Mode;;
0;0;0;0;;

### The synchronization source for the Aerodiode to use (0 = TTL, 1 = Low-voltage
### differential signaling, 2 = Internal)
Synchro;;
0;0;0;0;;

### The Aerodiode delay line (0 = None, 1 = Internal)
Delay Line;;
0;0;0;0;;

### Power the laser on or off (0 = Off, 1 = On)
Laser Power;;
1;1;1;1;;

### The current to drive each of the diodes at in units of milliamps. Note that the
### current has to be set as an integer percent of the maximum current. Therefore
### the current setting may need to be changed to match this. For example, with a max
### of 250 mA, current setting needs to be in steps of 2.5. This is most important
### when running the Configure Receiver Scan program. 
Current;;
170;180;170;190;;

### The offset of the Aerodiode pulsed or CW drive current in milliamps
Offset Current;;
0;0;0;0;;

### The width of the desired pulses in picoseconds. Note that this is not used in the
### TTL synchro mode but it set as a safeguard incase internal mode is selected.
Pulse Width;;
100000;100000;100000;100000;;

### The temperature to stabilize each diode to in units of Celsius
Temperature;;
25;25;25;25;;

### The delay of the diodes when set in internal mode in units of picoseconds.
Delay Out;;
0;0;0;0;;

### The frequency of the diodes when set in internal mode in units of Hz. Note that
### this is not used in the TTL synchro mode but it set as a safeguard incase internal
### mode is selected.
Frequency;;
8000;8000;8000;8000;;

### The gain used to read the internal power monitor (don't change this).
Monitor Gain;;
10;10;10;10;;

### The value of the internal interlock for the Aerodiode driver (0 = Off, 1 = Interlocked)
Interlock;;
0;0;0;0;;

### The maximum mean current that the Aerodiode driver can supply in units of milliamps. Note
### that the actual current needs to be an integer multiple of this value as a percent, i.e.
### picking a reasonably round number here is helpful.
Max Mean Current;;
250;250;250;250;;

### The maximum absolute current that the Aerodiode driver can supply in units of milliamps.
Max Current;;
250;250;250;250;;

### The serial numbers of each Aerodiode device. This must match the order of the comm ports
### above to communicate with the devices. This is insurance against comm ports being reassigned
Serial Number;;
2110029;2110079;2110165;2110164;;

### The current to drive each of the diodes at in units of milliamps. Note that the
### current has to be set as an integer percent of the maximum current. Therefore
### the current setting may need to be changed to match this. For example, with a max
### of 250 mA, current setting needs to be in steps of 2.5. This is most important
### when running the Configure Receiver Scan program. 
Scan Current;;
92.5;85;55;60;;

### File paths to the data logging locations for the Aerodiode controller. The order is
### 1) Where to write the raw data, 2) What base name to call the logging data files, 3)
### Where to find the user logging program, and 4) Where to find the user permissions program
