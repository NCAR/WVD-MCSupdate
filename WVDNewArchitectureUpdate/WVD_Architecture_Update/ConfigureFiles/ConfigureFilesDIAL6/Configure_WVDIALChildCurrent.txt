This file is used to define the initial state of the MPD main current monitor labview program.

### This is where the Labview code should find the current monitor. The elements here are:
### 1) IP Address, 2) Port, 3) Communication timeout in [ms], 4) Header bytes, and 5) Bytes
### to read if the element is an IP address.
Current Monitor Comm Port;;
192.168.0.164;502;3000;-1;-1;;

### These are miscellaneous variables that are read and used as default values by the current
### monitor. These are currently: 1) the update period of the current monitor in seconds,
### 2) the number of measurements to save, and 3) the number of variables to keep.
Child Variables;;
7;900;5;;

### Locations of the current monitor sleeves in the ADAM module. For translation of the numbers
### see TypeDef_CurrentMonitorLocations.ctl.
Current Monitor Locations;;
2;3;6;4;5;;

### File paths to the data storage and data logging locations and functions. The order is
### 1) Where to write the raw data, 2) What base name to call the current monitor data files,
### 3) What base name to call the logging files, 4) Where to find the user logging program,
### and 5) Where to find the user permissions program
