This file is used to define the initial state of the MPD main weather station labview program.

### This is the communication protocol to use for the weather station.
### (RS485-to-USB = 0, RS485-to-Ethernet = 1)
Communication Protocol;;
1;;

### This is where the Labview code should find the weather station (if using USB).
Comm Port;;
COM15;;

### This is where the Labview code should find the weather station (if using TCP).
### The elements here are: 1) IP Address, 2) Port, 3) Communication timeout in [ms],
### 4) Header bytes, and 5) Bytes to read if the element is an IP address.
TCP Info;;
192.168.0.110;4760;100;-1;-1;;

### These are miscellaneous variables that are read and used as default values
### by the weather station. These are currently: 1) the update period of the weather
### station in seconds, 2) the time to wait between write and read of the comm port,
### 3) The number of measurements to save, and 4) the number of weather station
### variables to keep.
Child Variables;;
5;50;1440;4;;

### File paths to the data storage and data logging locations and functions. The order is
### 1) Where to write the raw data, 2) What base name to call the weather station data files,
### 3) What base name to call the logging files, 4) Where to find the user logging program,
### and 5) Where to find the user permissions program

### This is currently unused but was intended to be used as the starting point to 
### set the initial state of the plot bounds. It is likely not necessary if
### we keep autoscaling the plots.
