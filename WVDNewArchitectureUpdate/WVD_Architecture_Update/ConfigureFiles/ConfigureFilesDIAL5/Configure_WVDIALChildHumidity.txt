This file is used to define the initial state of the humidity sensor in the Water Vapor DIAL Main labview program. 

### This is where the Labview code should find the humidity sensor.
IP Address;;
192.168.0.170; 161; 750; -1; -1;;

### These are miscellaneous variables that are read and used as default values
### by the humidity sensor. These are currently: 1) the update period of the humidity
### sensor in seconds, 2) the number of measurements to save, and then requirements to
### turn on the hygrostat including: 3) Measurements to average, 4) Required run time,
### 5) Required cadance 6) Limit of relative humidity, 7) 1= Allow heaters to turn on or
### 0=Don't allow heaters on and finally 8) the number of humidity sensor variables to keep.
Child Variables;;
4;4500;300;10;12;50;1;5;;

### File paths to the data storage and data logging locations and functions.
FilePaths;;
.\Data\HumiditySensor\;
Humidity;
HumLogging;
.\ContainerResources.llb\Log_SetUserComment.vi;
.\ContainerResources.llb\Idle_Password.vi;;

### This is currently unused but was intended to be used as the starting point to 
### set the initial state of the plot bounds. It is likely not necessary if
### we keep autoscaling the plots.
Plot Bounds;;
1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;;

### This is where the Labview code should find the switch to turn on the hygrostat. The elements
### here are: 1) IP Address, 2) Port, 3) Communication timeout in [ms], 4) Header bytes, and
### 5) Bytes to read if the element is an IP address.
Switch IP Address;;
