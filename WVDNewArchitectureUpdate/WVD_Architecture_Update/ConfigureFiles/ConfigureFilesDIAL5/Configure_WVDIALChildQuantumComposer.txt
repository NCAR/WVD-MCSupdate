This file is used to define the initial state of the MPD master clock labview program.
Note that some settings can be for operations or for the receiver scans. Both are loaded
and one is selected based on the desired setup from the user.

### This is where the Labview code should find the quantum composer. The elements are:
### 1) IP Address, 2) Port, 3) Communication timeout in [ms], 4) Header bytes, and
### 5) Bytes to read.

### Update times used to check the quantum composer. The first number is the 
### Fast update time which is how often to check if the system is in run/stop 
### mode. The second is slow update time and is how often to check the complete
### Quantum Composer state.
